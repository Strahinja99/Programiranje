          <p>Ryzen utilizes AMD's unified Socket AM4. However, Ryzen 7 processors are a complete system on a chip, integrating the northbridge and the memory controller, along with much of the southbridge on-die. These processors includes 16 PCIe lanes for a GPU along with an NVMe controller and an additional 4 PCIe lanes for I/O along with SATA and USB 3.0 links. Ryzen 7 desktop SoCs do not incorporate an integrated graphics processors.

The Ryzen 7 family became AMD's first series of processors to compete in the high-performance desktop market for the first time in over half a decade.</p>

          <p>Coffee Lake-based Core i5s were introduced in late 2017 with a number of high-end SKUs. A larger number of SKUs were introduced in April 2018. Although they still use standard Socket LGA-1151, those parts are no longer backwards compatible with earlier 100/200-series chipsets and must be paired with an appropriate 300-series chipset. A significant configuration change has taken place with the introduction of Coffee Lake including bumping the core count for the Core i5s from 4 cores to 6 and appropriately increasing the L3 cache which has significantly increased the performance of those parts over the prior generation.</p>
